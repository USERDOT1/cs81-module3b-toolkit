I noticed a pattern when I checked whether the squares of numbers would be even or odd. It turns out it alternated between even and odd forever.
I feel like this kind of logic might be used when you need to repeat specific calculations over and over again. This way once you make the functions,
you can call them from another function that does the specific calculation you want (like an automatic formula).
